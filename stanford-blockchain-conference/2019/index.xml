paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1188
Introduction I am going to be talking about batching techniques for accumulators with applications to interactive oracle proofs and blockchains. I&amp;rsquo;ll maybe also talk about how to make these proofs even smaller. The main thing that we are going to focus on today is the bitcoin state and this application of accumulators to bitcoin and blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Asics</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/asics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/asics/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} ASIC design for mining

Introduction I am an economist. I am going to stop apologizing about this now that I&amp;rsquo;ve said it once. I usually study market design. Bitcoin gives us new opportunities for how to design marketplaces. Regarding the talk title, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to claim that bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will be a monopoly.</description></item><item><title>Bloxroute</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/bloxroute/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} bloXroute: A network for tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s blockchain
Soumya Basu
Introduction Hi. I am Souyma and I am here to talk with you about Bloxroute. The elephant in the room is that blockchains have been claimed to solve everything like credit cards, social media, and global micropayments. To handle credit card payment volumes, blockchains need like 5000 transactions per second, for microtransactions you need 70000 transactions per second, and for social media even more.</description></item><item><title>Building Bulletproofs</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-bulletproofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/building-bulletproofs/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Building bulletproofs

Please welcome Vitalik who needs no introduction.
Introduction Okay. I have 20 minutes. I will get right to it. Vlad gave a presentation on some of his research into CBC Casper and how CBC Casper can be extended into sharding contexts. This presentation will be about taking some of the existing research into consensus algorithms and sharding and other things we have done in the last few years and see how they concretely translate into what is actually going to be deployed to Ethereum Foundation in the short to medium term future.</description></item><item><title>Formal Verification</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/formal-verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/formal-verification/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Formal verification: The road to complete security of smart contracts

Introduction Thank you everyone. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to be here speaking about formal verification. The road to complete security of smart contracts is a sensationalist title. I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending a few moments making a huge disclaimer.
Disclaimer This can only be interpreted as a very long road or a very narrow sense in which complete security is actually cheap.</description></item><item><title>Handel Practical Multisig Aggregation</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/handel-practical-multisig-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/handel-practical-multisig-aggregation/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Handel: Practical multi-signature aggregation for large byzantine committees
Nicolas Gailly
Introduction Handle is a aggregation protocol for large scale byzantine committees. This is work with my colleagues in addition to myself.
Why aggregate? Distributed systems often require gathering statements about large subsets of nodes. However, processing (filtering, aggregating&amp;hellip;) measurements can be a bottleneck. We want to apply some processing while collecting the measurements.</description></item><item><title>Htlcs Considered Harmful</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/htlcs-considered-harmful/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} HTLCs considered harmful
Daniel Robinson (Paradigm)
https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1091033955824881664
Introduction I am here to talk about a design pattern that I don&amp;rsquo;t like. You see HTLCs a lot. You see them in a lot of protocols for cross-chain atomic exchanges and payment channel networks such as lightning. But they have some downsides, which people aren&amp;rsquo;t all familiar with. I am not affiliated with Interledger, but they convinced me that HTLCs were a bad idea and they developed an alternative to replace HTLCs.</description></item><item><title>Links</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/links/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} info: https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19

http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/multi-hop-locks/
Introduction This is joint work with my collaborators. Permissionless blockchains have some issues. The permissionless nature leads to the transaction rate that they have. This limits widespread adoption of blockchain technology like bitcoin or ethereum. Scalability approaches can be roughly grouped into two groups, one is on-chain layer 1 solutions.</description></item><item><title>Proofs Of Space And Replication</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/proofs-of-space-and-replication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/proofs-of-space-and-replication/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Tight proofs of space and and replication

paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/702.pdf
Introduction This talk is about proofs of space and tight proofs of space.
Proof of Space A proof-of-space is an alternative to proof-of-work. Applications have been proposed like spam prevention, DoS attack prevention, sybil resistance in consensus networks which is most relevant to this conference. In proof-of-space, it&amp;rsquo;s an interactive protocol between a miner and a prover who has some disk storage and claims that hey I am storing 1 gigabyte of data.</description></item><item><title>Quisquis</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/quisquis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/quisquis/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Quisquis: A new design for anonymous cryptocurrencies

Threshold signatures Threshold signature schemes are schemes where n parties and at least t are necessary and sufficient for signing. They want to make sure that t parties are necessary. Any threshold signature scheme typically has 3 protocols: key generation, signing, and verifying.
In key generation, one party creates a group public key as an output.</description></item><item><title>Thundercore</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/stanford-blockchain-conference/2019/thundercore/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Thundercore consensus

Introduction If you find a bug in a smart contract, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to mitigate that bug. In formal verification, we really look for bugs. We can identify subtle bugs, like reentrancy attacks, ownership violation, incorrect transactions, bugs due to updated code. We also want to assure the absence of bugs.</description></item></channel></rss>
