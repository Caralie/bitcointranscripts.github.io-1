I am talking about block size, but not any particular proposal. Why do we have the block size limit and is it a good thing in the first place? The block size exists as a denial-of-service limiter. It limits the amount of resources that a node validating the blockchain can exhaust when validating a block. We want to do this because in the early days of bitcoin there are often certain kinds of transactions there are ways to slow down a validator by using a non-standard transaction or filling up a block with tons of spam.</description></item><item><title>Amiko Pay</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/amiko-pay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/amiko-pay/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Amiko Pay

Amiko Pay aims to become an implementation of the lightning network. So that previous presentation was a great setup. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit more to Amiko Pay. If you look through the basic design of the lightning network, there&amp;rsquo;s a network of payment channels. There have been several variations of this idea. Lightning Network happens to be the best so far.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Block Propagation Iblt Rusty Russell</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/bitcoin-block-propagation-iblt-rusty-russell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/bitcoin-block-propagation-iblt-rusty-russell/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Rusty Russell
This is not what I do. But I was doing it anyway.
The problem is that blocks are transmitted in their entirety. If you have a 1 MB uplink and you&amp;rsquo;re connecting to 8 peers, your first peer will see a 1MB block in about 66.8 seconds. And the last one will get it in 76.4 seconds, because we basically blast out blocks in parallel to our peers.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Failure Modes And The Role Of The Lightning Network</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/bitcoin-failure-modes-and-the-role-of-the-lightning-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/bitcoin-failure-modes-and-the-role-of-the-lightning-network/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Thaddeus Dryja

Our goal for this project, our rationale of what we&amp;rsquo;re interesting is when many transactions arrive in a short period of time. This could be because of denial of service attacks where few entities are creating a large number of transactions, or many people wanting to create transactions, like a shopping spree.</description></item><item><title>Block Synchronization Time</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/block-synchronization-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/block-synchronization-time/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Initial Block Synchronization Time Complexity

Block synchronization is how nodes join the market. New nodes download the blockchain and validate everything. This is how the security of the network works. Who is responsible for doing this? Everyone must be doing a full block synchronization. If you are not doing this, you&amp;rsquo;re not on the bitcoin network.</description></item><item><title>Blockchain Testbed</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/blockchain-testbed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/blockchain-testbed/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Ittay Eyal

Jeff Garzik (jgarzik)
Bitcoin was introduced as a p2p electronic cash system. That&amp;rsquo;s what it says in the whitepaper. That&amp;rsquo;s what the users were exposed to. The 1 MB block size was set for anti-spam purposes. Otherwise when bitcoin value is low, it&amp;rsquo;s trivial to DOS the network with large blocks.
Moving on to some observations.</description></item><item><title>More Core Devs</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/more-core-devs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/more-core-devs/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} 10x the number of core devs

I am from Princeton University. I am here to talk about the scalability issues that non-currency applications of bitcoin have that might be a little different than regular payments that go through the bitcoin network. I put this together with my advisor, Arvind. The reason why I want to talk about this is because when people talk about how bitcoin will have to scale is that people throw out a thing about Visa processing 20,000 transactions per second or something.</description></item><item><title>Overview Of Security Concerns</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/overview-of-security-concerns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/overview-of-security-concerns/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} petertodd

Miners have another job as well. Miners are commodity producers, they produce something that the world has never seen. They produce block space, which is room for transactional debt. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore what the field of economics tells us. We&amp;rsquo;ll plot the total number of bytes per block. On the vertical we will plot the unit cost of the commodity, or the price of 1 transaction worth of blockspace.</description></item><item><title>Privacy And Fungibility</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/privacy-and-fungibility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/privacy-and-fungibility/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Privacy and scalability
Even though Bitcoin is the worst privacy system ever, everyone in the community very strongly values privacy.
There are at least three things: privacy censorship resistance fungibility
The easiest way to censor things is to punish communication, not prevent communication. Privacy is the weakest link in censorship resistance. Fungibility is an absolute necessity for any medium of exchange.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preserving Smart Contracts</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/privacy-preserving-smart-contracts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/privacy-preserving-smart-contracts/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Ranjit Kumaresan

We have been looking at how much we can support or what limitations we might encounter. There are also efficiency issues and privacy guarantees.

A lot of people were reducing their security model by not validating their bitcoin. It was potentially less secure. That&amp;rsquo;s not something that relay networks try to address. The big issue with the decreasing number of nodes, which the relay network doesn&amp;rsquo;t address, is that it reduces the resilience against attack. If there&amp;rsquo;s only 100 nodes, there&amp;rsquo;s really only some 100 VPses that you have to knock offline before the bitcoin network stops working.</description></item><item><title>Reworking Bitcoin Core P2P Code For Robustness And Event Driven</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/reworking-bitcoin-core-p2p-code-for-robustness-and-event-driven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/reworking-bitcoin-core-p2p-code-for-robustness-and-event-driven/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Cory Fields

So hopefully I summarized this reasonably. There were a number of things that came up in our discussion. It would help SPV a lot if there were UTXO commitments in blocks.

Miners no longer incentivized to mine all the time. The future of mining hardware. Impact on the bitcoin ecosystem. Implications and assumptions of the model.
Are minting rewards and transaction fees the same? Transaction fees are time-dependent. A miner can only claim transaction fees as transactions are added to their block. As transaction fees start to dominate the block reward, they become time-dependent.</description></item><item><title>Sharding The Blockchain</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/sharding-the-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/sharding-the-blockchain/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Sharding the blockchain

How wallets can handle real transaction fees
You should have a market at this point, where some number of transactions never happen because they aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to pay a fee. So you get some equilibrium of price going on.
