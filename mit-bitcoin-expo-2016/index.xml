Welcome everyone to MIT Bitcoin Expo 2016. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Bitcoin by now, then I am not sure how you got here. My name is nchinda. I am the reigning Bitcoin club president. I am going to have some fun. The club is hijacking the #mit-dci IRC channel.</description></item><item><title>Fraud Proofs Petertodd</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/fraud-proofs-petertodd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/fraud-proofs-petertodd/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Fraud proofs

In Bitcoin we have made this tradeoff where we don&amp;rsquo;t have everyone running full nodes. Not everyone is participating equally. If you have a full node, you have lots of gigs of hard drive space, but if you do that, you only get a few transactions per second. Modularizing validation an argument for this is how to improve on this situation.</description></item><item><title>Lessons For Bitcoin From 150 Years Of Decentralization</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/lessons-for-bitcoin-from-150-years-of-decentralization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/lessons-for-bitcoin-from-150-years-of-decentralization/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Lessons for Bitcoin from the 150-year History of Decentralization

Another 30 seconds. Take your seats. We have Arvind Narayanan. Some of the research from Princeton has rivaled the work of MIT.

Alex Zinder
I have heard that Alex Zinder has a grasp of what makes NASDAQ Linq good and bad, and the advantages of a public versus permissioned blockchain. Alex is director of global software development at NASDAQ, but he is here to talk about Linq, which is a platform for managing securities. Alex?
This is possibly Adam Ludwin&amp;rsquo;s / chain.</description></item><item><title>Maaku Panel</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/maaku-panel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/maaku-panel/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} This can be a broad range of topics for improvements.

Forked to Death: What Internet governance can learn from Bitcoin
So, the last talk today is going to be from Pindar Wong. He&amp;rsquo;s been involved with Internet in Hong Kong. He also helped organize the Scaling Bitcoin workshops. It&amp;rsquo;s my pleasure to have him speaking today.
Okay. Thank you very much for staying until the bitter end. My topic today is forked to death, what Internet governance can learn from Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>R3</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/r3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/r3/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Distributed Ledger Group
R3
Kathleen Breitman
I work at R3. It manages the distributed ledger group, of 42 banks interested in using blockchain or distributed ledger tech. People wonder when I tell them that I work for a consortium that wants to use electronic ledgers. What does that have to do with capital markets?
Ledgers can track transactions. Typically in a capital market context, this responsibility falls to the backoffice.</description></item><item><title>Rootstock</title><link>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/rootstock/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bitcointranscripts.github.io/mit-bitcoin-expo-2016/rootstock/</guid><description>{% if page.transcript_by %} Transcript by: {{ page.transcript_by }}{% endif %} Rootstock

The Scaling Debate is a Proxy Battle Over Centralization
I really appreciated the fact that&amp;hellip;. I really appreciated Cory&amp;rsquo;s talk. I quoted someone in my talk. It was a fairly recent quote. His whole talk was speaking about governance.

David Vorick
I have been working on a decentralized cloud storage platform. Before I go into that, I wanted to mention that I have been working on Bitcoin since 2011. Since 2013 I have been in the wizards channel. In 2014 a friend and myself founded a company to build Siacoin. The team has grown to 3 people. Sia is the name of our decentralized storage protocol.</description></item></channel></rss>
